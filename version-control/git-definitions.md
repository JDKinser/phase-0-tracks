# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

1. What is version control?  Why is it useful?
 * Git is a version control tool. It allows you to keep track of work done and it allows you to revert changes if needed among many other things.
 * It's useful in many ways but one of them is that it allows a team of people to work on a single file without compromising the master.
2. What is a branch and why would you use one?
 * A branch is a copy of whatever you are working on. You would use a branch to work on a file without changing the master. That allows you test things without compromising the original code.
3. What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
 * After you add the file its in the staging area waiting for you to commit it. This allows you to add a message telling you or a teammate how you changed the file.
 * A good commit message is something that is descriptive. Detail is always good.
4. What is a merge conflict?
 * When you try to merge your branch to the master or pushing to a hub and your code conflicts with another coders work or code that you have done.
