# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

1. What is version control?  Why is it useful?
 * Git is a version control tool. It allows you to keep track of work done and it allows you to revert changes if needed among many other things.
 * It's useful in many ways but one of them is that it allows a team of people to work on a single file without compromising the master.
2. What is a branch and why would you use one?
 * A branch is a copy of whatever you are working on. You would use a branch to work on a file without changing the master. That allows you test things without compromising the original code.
3. What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
 * After you add the file its in the staging area waiting for you to commit it. This allows you to add a message telling you or a teammate how you changed the file.
 * A good commit message is something that is descriptive. Detail is always good.
4. What is a merge conflict?
 * When you try to merge your branch to the master or pushing to a hub and your code conflicts with another coders work or code that you have done.
 * You would resolve the conflict by deciding which code you actually want to have running and make changes accordingly.
5. Three states of a git file.
 * First is untracked or modified which is after you change or add a file in your repo
 * Second is staged where git will save or snapshot the file and store it in the repo
 * Third is committed which allows you to revert back to this state if needed.
6. Differences of git and github.
 * To put it simply Git is a tool and GitHub is a service for projects that use Git.
7. Why use GitHub
 * GitHub is great for a few reasons. One of the greatest things is protection. If you use GitHub you are saving your project in the "cloud" which allows you to access it from any computer. Github also allows you to share your project with a group so you can have a team working on it all in one place.
