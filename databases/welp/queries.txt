**You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

It doesn't look pretty, but:

**INPUT**

SELECT users.*, business.*, reviews.*
FROM reviews
    JOIN users
        ON users.id = reviews.user_id
    JOIN business
        ON business.id = reviews.business_id;


**OUTPUT**

4|Steven|Wonder|3|The Beagle Nightclub|1|5|I thought the place looked great!|3|4
5|Holly|Berry|4|Lotus Yoga|2|4|Very flexible scheduling!|4|5
1|Bradford|Pitt|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|3|Extremely predictable|1|1
7|Denzel|George|5|Plumbing by Janet|4|2|Terrible service!|5|7        

**There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

**INPUT**

SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, business.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment
FROM reviews
    JOIN users
        ON users.id = reviews.user_id
    JOIN business
        ON business.id = reviews.business_id;

**OUTPUT**

Steven|Wonder|The Beagle Nightclub|5|I thought the place looked great!
Holly|Berry|Lotus Yoga|4|Very flexible scheduling!
Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Extremely predictable
Denzel|George|Plumbing by Janet|2|Terrible service!        

**How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

**INPUT**

SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, business.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment
FROM reviews
    JOIN users
        ON users.id = reviews.user_id
    JOIN business
        ON business.id = reviews.business_id
WHERE business.name = "Lotus Yoga";

**OUTPUT**

Holly|Berry|Lotus Yoga|4|Very flexible scheduling!
