**You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

It doesn't look pretty, but:

SELECT users.*, business.*, reviews.*
FROM reviews
    JOIN users
        ON users.id = reviews.user_id
    JOIN business
        ON business.id = reviews.business_id;


**There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, business.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment
FROM reviews
    JOIN users
        ON users.id = reviews.user_id
    JOIN business
        ON business.id = reviews.business_id;

**How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, business.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment
FROM reviews
    JOIN users
        ON users.id = reviews.user_id
    JOIN business
        ON business.id = reviews.business_id
WHERE business.name = "Lotus Yoga";
