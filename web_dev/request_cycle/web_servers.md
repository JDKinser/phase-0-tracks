1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
	* Linux is free and open-source. From all that I am reading on the subject, is the 
	whole thing has been built over time by volunteers. It also seems like most OS besides
	windows seems to be based off of linux.
	
2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
	* A VPS is basically a virtual computer that the server runs off of. It is a partitioned
	section of an already existing server. They act like computers in the facts they have their own OS and things like storage.
	
3. Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
	* In terms that we are all used to hearing, its a lot like working on a master branch in git. You have access to everything as root. Its like god mode.
