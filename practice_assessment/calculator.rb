# Practice
# write a method that takes three parameters:
# an integer, an operator string (example: "+"), and another integer

# I cant figure out how to add the operator string in the time alloted so I am going to go for a longer route.

# define method that takes two integers and makes array.

def calculate
  [n1,n2].map{ |x| x.chomp.to_i }
end
